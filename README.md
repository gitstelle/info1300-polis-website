# Cornell Polis Website

This group project was the final for INFO 1300: Introductory Design and Programming for the Web in spring 2023. We were tasked to design a static website for a client on campus. We worked with Polis, a pre-government fraternity that has a chapter at Cornell University, who did not have an existing website. The website submitted for this project can be found [here](https://gitstelle.github.io/info1300-polis-website/).
